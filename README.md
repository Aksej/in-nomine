This is a utility for creating, accessing, and managing custom namespaces in Common Lisp. Originally started as a fork of [`lisp-namespace`](https://github.com/guicho271828/lisp-namespace), it became its own piece of software that is *somewhat* backwards compatible with it.

Don't use it yet - it's volatile software that changes by the minute.
